<h1 class="title">Dear Community,</h1>

Many of you are not satsified with the management reshuffle that took place several days ago. I want to explain my side of the story - in an unbiased and calm manner.

<br>

Lets start off with the former co-owner - <b>Squeezy</b>. Squeezy was a valued member of the community, but towards the end of his management career with us, he had proven two things to Tyler and myself:

<br>

<div class="list is-dark">
    <div class="list-item">
        He can no longer be active.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        He never cared about Kynno -- only using it to boost his own reputation, show how he can "save" failing Discord Servers. A medal, if you will.
    </div>
</div>

Even before all of this, Squeezy had went behind my back on numerous occassions. Taking to mocking us on other Discord servers as well as collaborating with raiders. When he left, he left due to "poor quality-control". Which is his phrasing for "I only cared about my role".

<br>
<hr>
<br>
Now, lets discuss <b>Ram</b>. Ram was also a valued member of the community -- excluding the fact that the community never knew about how he also collaborated with raiders. Even hijacking a server I had owned, in the name of "restoring" it. Not only that, he had continued to grow more negativity towards us. Tyler and I decided he should've been demoted ages ago, he was demoted for the following reasons:

<br>

<div class="list is-dark">
    <div class="list-item">
        He couldn't be trusted with the manager role. 
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        He was an inexperienced manager, which is no longer tolerable.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        He has been negative towards Kynno and myself for a while now, this was due to happen.
    </div>
</div>

<br>

<br>
<b>Pikey</b> was only demoted due to inactivity. He has been given a chance to be more active via the administrator role.
<br>

<br>

(Note, I only demoted them. They left on their own accord. We are not responsible for kicking, banning or "firing them".)

Now this is over, we will be closing this drama permanently. Discussion of this drama will no longer be tolerated. It's a new era and a new beginning for Kynno!
