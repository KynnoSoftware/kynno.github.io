<h1 class="title">Dear Community,</h1>

2019 was a good and also a bad year for us. We managed to amass 150 members, we have established a foothole in Discord Communities: being one of the most active (for our size). During 2019 though, we have faced a numerous amount of scandals and drama that will not be mentioned in this post. We have big plans for 2020, and we want to explain them in detail, with our community and those who may be interested in joining!

<br>

<h1 class="title">Our main aims for 2020:</h1>

<div class="list is-dark">
    <div class="list-item">
        Cut down on drama by improving our staffing and having better, stricter rules.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        A new, modern, competent staff team that is willing and able to enforce the rules and contribute to our growth.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Clearer, better set of rules that is easily understandable by all.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Get rid of carl-bot and replace with a new version of KynnoBot.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Move KynnoBot from Red to our own source code.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Better emojis, better channels and better assignable roles.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Exclusive VIP, Server Booster and Donator Features.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Start Advertisements, paying to advertise on some services.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Trademark "Kynno" by August, 2020 in the UK, EU and US.
    </div>
    <div class="list-item">
        Weekly events and Monthly Giveaways. Giveaways will be random, ranging from Games to Nitro.
    </div>
</div>

With these reforms, I believe that we can create a Kynno that is active and better than ever before.
